      <h2>All about Bunny or Rabbit</h2>

      <p>
        Rabbits, also known as bunnies or bunny rabbits, 
        are small mammals in the family Leporidae (along with the hare) of the order Lagomorpha 
        (along with the pika). Oryctolagus cuniculus includes the European rabbit species and its descendants, 
        the world's 305 breeds[1] of domestic rabbit. Sylvilagus includes 13 wild rabbit species, 
        among them the seven types of cottontail. The European rabbit, which has been introduced 
        on every continent except Antarctica, is familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal and 
        as a domesticated form of livestock and pet. With its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, 
        the rabbit is, in many areas of the world, a part of daily life—as food, clothing, 
        a companion, and a source of artistic inspiration.

      <h2>Terminology and etymology</h2>

      <p>
        Male rabbits are called bucks; females are called does. An older term for an adult rabbit used 
        until the 18th century is coney (derived ultimately from the Latin cuniculus), 
        while rabbit once referred only to the young animals.[2] Another term for a young rabbit is bunny, 
        though this term is often applied informally (particularly by children) to rabbits generally, 
        especially domestic ones. More recently, the term kit or kitten has been used to refer to a young rabbit.
        A group of rabbits is known as a colony or nest (or, occasionally, a warren, 
        though this more commonly refers to where the rabbits live).[3] A group of 
        baby rabbits produced from a single mating is referred to as a litter[4] and 
        a group of domestic rabbits living together is sometimes called a herd.[5]
        The word rabbit itself derives from the Middle English rabet, 
        a borrowing from the Walloon robète, which was a diminutive of the French or Middle Dutch robbe.[6]

      <h2>Morphology</h2>

      <p>
        The anatomy of rabbits' hind limbs are structurally similar to that of other land mammals and 
        contribute to their specialized form of locomotion. The bones of the hind limbs consist of long 
        bones (the femur, tibia, fibula, and phalanges) as well as short bones (the tarsals). 
        These bones are created through endochondral ossification during development. 
        Like most land mammals, the round head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum of the ox coxae. 
        The femur articulates with the tibia, but not the fibula, which is fused to the tibia. The tibia and 
        fibula articulate with the tarsals of the pes, commonly called the foot. The hind limbs of the rabbit 
        are longer than the front limbs. This allows them to produce their hopping form of locomotion. 
        Longer hind limbs are more capable of producing faster speeds. Hares, which have longer legs 
        than cottontail rabbits, are able to move considerably faster.[13] Rabbits stay just on their 
        toes when moving; this is called Digitigrade locomotion. The hind feet have four long toes 
        that allow for this and are webbed to prevent them from spreading when hopping.[14] 
        Rabbits do not have paw pads on their feet like most other animals that use digitigrade 
        locomotion. Instead, they have coarse compressed hair that offers protection.[15]
